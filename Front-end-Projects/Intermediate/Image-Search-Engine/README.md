## API

This project uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch images and their descriptions. To use the API, you need an API key from Unsplash. 

### Example API Request

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const apiUrl = `https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?query=${searchQuery}&client_id=${apiKey}`;

fetch(apiUrl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Handle the data from the API
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching the images:', error);
    });


### Note:

1. **Replace `yourusername` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username.
2. **Include your actual API key in place of `YOUR_API_KEY` in the API request example.
3. **Add any additional acknowledgments or sections that are relevant to your project.
