            <i><b><p>Born in 1891 in Mhow, India, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar faced discrimination and inequality due to his Dalit
                background. Despite facing immense obstacles, he pursued education, earning multiple degrees including a
                doctorate from Columbia University.</p>
            <p>Ambedkar became a prominent figure in India's struggle for social justice and equality. He fought against
                caste-based discrimination and championed the rights of Dalits, advocating for their inclusion in all
                aspects of society.</p>

            <p>His pivotal role in drafting the Indian Constitution as the chairman of the Drafting Committee in 1947
                marked a significant milestone in Indian history. He ensured the inclusion of provisions for social
                justice, equality, and fundamental rights.</p>

            <p>Post-independence, Ambedkar held several key positions in the government, including as India's first
                Minister of Law and Justice. He continued his tireless efforts for the upliftment of marginalized
                communities, advocating for land reforms, reservations, and educational opportunities.</p>

            <p>Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in 1956, seeing it as a means to escape the caste system's shackles. He passed
                away in 1956, leaving behind a legacy of social reform, legal scholarship, and advocacy for the
                oppressed. His teachings continue to inspire millions and his contributions to Indian society remain
                invaluable.</p></b></i>
