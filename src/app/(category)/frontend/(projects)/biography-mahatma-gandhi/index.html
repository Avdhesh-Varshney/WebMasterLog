                        Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, experienced a formative childhood steeped in the cultural and spiritual richness of Hindu traditions. Raised in a household that valued truth and compassion, young Gandhi imbibed a sense of morality. This early influence would later manifest in his commitment to social justice. The cultural mosaic of his early years laid a profound foundation for the development of a visionary leader advocating for nonviolence, human rights, and the dismantling of social inequities. His father's name was Karamchand Gandhi and his mother's name was Putlibai. At the age of 13, Mahatma Gandhi was married to Kasturba which is an arranged marriage.

                    <p>Gandhi's educational journey took him to London, where he pursued a law degree at University College London, graduating in 1891. In May 1893 he went to South Africa to work as a lawyer. There he had a first-hand experience of <b>racial discrimination </b>when he was thrown out of the first-class apartment of the train despite holding the first-class ticket because it was reserved for white people only and no Indian or <b>black </b> allowed to travel in the first class. This incident had a serious effect on him and he decided to protest against racial discrimination. Gandhi's time in London set the stage for his future role as a global advocate for nonviolent resistance.</p>

                     <p>Post-Independence, Gandhi dedicated himself to the monumental task of healing the wounds of communal division and shaping the nascent nation of India. Advocating for nonviolence, communal harmony, and inclusive nation-building, he sought to foster a spirit of unity among the diverse communities. Despite the challenges of guiding a newly independent nation, Gandhi's unwavering commitment to principles of nonviolence and social justice continued to influence the direction of India's early years as a sovereign state.Gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the British rule but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in Calcutta on 15 August 1947. </p>

            <p>Tragically, Mahatma Gandhi's life was abruptly cut short on January 30, 1948, when he fell victim to an assassin's bullet in New Delhi. His assassination was a profound loss, not only for India but for the global community. However, Gandhi's legacy endured, transcending his physical presence. His teachings on nonviolence, equality, and justice remained a beacon of hope and inspiration, guiding movements for civil rights and social justice worldwide. Gandhi's life and death, though marked by tragedy, became a testament to the enduring power of nonviolent resistance in the face of adversity.</p>
