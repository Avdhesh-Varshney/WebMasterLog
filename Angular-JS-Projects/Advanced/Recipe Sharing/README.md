# CookBook

The Global Cookbook project is an innovative platform where users from around the world can upload and share authentic cuisine recipes. Built using Angular, the platform allows users to contribute their recipes by uploading videos, images, and other relevant content. Other users can then explore the vast collection of recipes, watch instructional videos, and discover culinary delights from various cultures. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive recipe database, the Global Cookbook provides a hub for culinary enthusiasts to connect, learn, and share their love for international cuisine.
