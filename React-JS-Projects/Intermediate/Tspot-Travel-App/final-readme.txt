A react based travel website where everything is a component starting from the Navbar and ending with footer. Props are also passed down from one component to another. BrowserRouter, Link, Switch, Route are used to navigate between components or should I say pages. I've also created the sub-pages and added some additional features like photo gallery with filter, etc. I've also used useState hook for state management and useEffect to re-render while user-interaction :)
